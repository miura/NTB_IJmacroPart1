In the parenthesis after ``if'', there is obvious TRUE statement (5 is not 4).
This is true, so the macro function bounded by curly braces is executed, which is to
print out ``true'' in the log window.

Try changing the line 2 to \ilcom{if (5 == 4)}. Running this prints nothing
in the log window, because 5 is not 4 (FALSE!) so that the macro function in
line 3 is ignored. To avoid such ignorant no-output behavior, you could add
``else'' as follows.
