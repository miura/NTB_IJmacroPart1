Did you get some results printed out? It should, but you should read the code carefully as there is a small trick in this code.  This trick is something special in IJ macro language compared to other general scripting languages.

You might have noticed a strange expression at line 8, in the way it assigns the variable \ilcom{txt}. 
It starts with double quotation marks. \\
