With this assignment, the variable is now a "numerical variable" or simply "variable". 
In other programming languages such as C or Java, difference between numbers and characters matters a lot. 
In ImageJ macro you do not have to care whether the variable is number or string (we call them ``types'') ad they are defined automatically by the type of value provided for a variable, and this makes the macro coding to be light and easy. However, since types are implicitly defined without declaration it could cause simple mistakes such as type mismatching. 
So be sure keep the difference in types DOES matter but they are not shown in the code. We will see an example of such confusion, 
and also a way to avoid the confusion.

Test the following macro to see how the numerical variable works.
