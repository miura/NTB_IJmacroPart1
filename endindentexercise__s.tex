\subsection{Recording ImageJ macro functions}
There are many commands in ImageJ. In the native ImageJ distribution, there are ca. 500 commands. In the Fiji distribution, there are 900+ commands. Some plugins are not macro-ready, but almost all of these commands can be accessed by build-in macro functions. That is great, but we then encounter a problem: how do we find a macro function that does what we want to do?

To show you how to find a function, we write a small macro that creates a new image, adds noise, blurs this image by Gaussian blurring, and then thresholds the image. There is a convenient tool called \textbf{Command Recorder} . 
Do \ijmenu{[PlugIns -> Macros -> Record\ldots]}. A window shown in figure
\ref{fig_macroRecorderBlank} opens.
