In this example, the exit condition for going out from looping is \ilcom{counter < 0}, and the initial value of \ilcom{counter} is 0, which does not satisfy that looping condition. Since this evaluation occurs only after the looping part is executed for the first time, the macro still prints out a line before it exits from the loop.

Condition for the while-statement could be various. Here is a small list of comparison operators.

\begin{tabular*}
{0.5\textwidth}{ l r }
< & less than \\
<= & less than or equal\\ 
> & greater than\\ 
>= & greater than or equal to\\
== & equal\\
!= & not equal\\
 
\end{tabular*}

Modify code 11 so that the macro prints out numbers from 200 to 100, with an increment of -10.

\item \textbf{Answer} : There could be slightly various ways to do this modification, but here is one way.
