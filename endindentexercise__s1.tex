\subsubsection{Why is there while-loop?}

An often raised question with the while-loop is why do we have two types of loops, 
the for-loop and the while-loop. Answering to this question, they have different
flexibility. The for-loop is rather solid and the while-loop is more flexible. In the
example code below, the user is asked for a correct number and if the answer is wrong, the
question is asked 5 times repeatedly. Number of loop is not determined by the
programmer, but interactively when the code is running. We will study
the branching of the program based on if-else in the next section.
