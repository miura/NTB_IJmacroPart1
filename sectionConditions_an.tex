\section{Conditions and Loops}
	In many cases, we want to iterate certain processing steps many times (see "Loops" in the figure \ref{fig_scriptscheme}), or we want to limit some of the process in the program only for certain situations (see "Conditions": in the figure \ref{fig_scriptscheme}). In this section we learn how to include these loops and conditional behaviors into macro.
