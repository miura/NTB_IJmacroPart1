Don't ignore quotation marks, parenthesis and the semi-colon! 
Syntax highlighter offers automatic coloring of ImageJ functions, because you selected the language "IJ macro" in above. It increases the readability of codes.

Then in the bottom-left corner of the script editor, there is a button labeled "Run". Clicking this, you will see that a log window is created (if it is already there, then it will have a new line) printing "Hello World!" (Figure \ref{fig_HelloWorldLog}). Another way to run the macro is via Script Editor menu,  \ijmenu{[Run -> Run]} . You could use Ctrl-R (Windows) or Command-R (OSX) as well.

Later when you want to start writing another macro, you could just create a new tab by \ijmenu{[File > New]} and then select \ijmenu{[Language -> ImageJ Macro]} again.
