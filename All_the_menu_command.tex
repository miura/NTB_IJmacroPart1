All the menu commands that you execute will be printed out as a history of macro functions in this window. For composing a macro using this recorder, we first do the processing manually from the menu as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Prepare a new image using \ijmenu{[File -> New]} command. The size of the image can be anything.
  \item Then do \ijmenu{[Process -> Noise -> Salt and Pepper]} (Fig.
  \ref{fig_SaltAndPepper}).
  \item \ijmenu{[Process -> Filters -> Gaussian Blur]} (use Sigma = 2.0).
  \item \ijmenu{[Image -> Adjust -> Threshold\ldots]}. Toggle the slider to make
  signals red. Check "Dark Background", then click "Apply".

\end{itemize}
