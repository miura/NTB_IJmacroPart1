These texts generated in the recorder can be used as it is in your macro.  You could copy and paste them\footnote{In case of OSX, you might probably need to click ``Create'' button to generate a duplicate of macro functions in a new script window. Then you could copy the macro functions from there.}. Compose a macro like below by copying and pasting the macro functions in the recorder.  Delete the lines that are commented out (lines that begin with "//" are lines that are skipped by the macro interpreter).
