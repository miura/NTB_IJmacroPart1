\subsubsection{Complex Conditions}
In many cases, you might need to evaluate the condition of multiple variables at once. 
For such demands, several different comparisons can be combined by using following Boolean operators.

\begin{indentCom}

\begin{tabular*}
{0.5\textwidth}{ l l }
\&\& & boolean AND\\
|| & boolean OR\\

\end{tabular*}

\end{indentCom}

Let's first test what these symbols do by directly using
\ilcom{true} and \ilcom{false} in macro.
