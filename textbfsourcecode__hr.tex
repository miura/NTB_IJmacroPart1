\textbf{sourcecode} : \href{http://www.example.com/contents}{code/code01\_51.ijm}

Then test also another macro when you put the same line after "Hello World!". 
What happened? Any difference in the behavior?

\item \textbf{Answer} : The first code prints "Hello World!", while the second code prints nothing. This is becaise \ilcom{print("\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}Clear")} is a command that clears the Log window. In the first code, ``Hello World'' is printed after the window clearing, and in the second case the Log window is wiped out right after the printing of ``Hello World''. Effectively it looks like nothing has happened.
